# EuroSAT Land Use & Land Cover Classification 🌍🛰️

This project uses the EuroSAT dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite images by land use and land cover type.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Google Colab (training)
- Streamlit (for frontend demo)
- Hugging Face Spaces (for deployment)

## 🎯 Goal
Build a deployable AI model that classifies satellite images from the EuroSAT dataset into 10 categories: residential, forest, river, etc.

## 🚀 Live Demo
TBA

## 📁 Structure
- `notebook/`: Jupyter/Colab notebooks
- `model/`: Saved model weights
- `utils/`: Utility scripts

## 👨‍💻 Author
Rayhan, aspiring data analyst with a passion for real-world geospatial AI projects.
